# Prediction of Heart Disease
I have done this project as a part of Artificial Intelligence course at Asia Univerisity winter program.
The objective of the project is to predict whether if a person has heart disease or not from the patient blood report. 
If they are at a risk of Heart Disease they may consult a doctore for better care and imporve there lifestyle.
